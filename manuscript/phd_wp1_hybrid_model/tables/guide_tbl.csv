Lag Llama,"Captures lag effects in demand, simple to implement",Limited to contexts with strong lagged relationships; underperforms in complex scenarios,High (higher computational cost),Situations with significant lag effects between past and future demand,"Assumes demand is heavily influenced by past values with strong lag effects, and future demand can be predicted by historical lags"
