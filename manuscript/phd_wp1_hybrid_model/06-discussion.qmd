## Findings

Among the methods evaluated, the Hybrid Weighted Averaging method stood out as a robust performer. In terms of mean MASE, it ranked second, and it achieved the top rank for mean CRPS, placing it on par with the best performing methods. Notably, the Nemenyi test revealed no significant performance differences between the Hybrid Weighted Averaging method and the RF method across both point and probabilistic forecasting. This result demonstrates that the Hybrid Weighted Averaging method is a reliable and accurate choice for forecasting contraceptive demand in contexts where probabilistic accuracy and low variance in forecasts are critical. Moreover, our analysis of forecast performance across multiple time horizons found that the Hybrid Weighted Averaging method maintained stable accuracy, which is crucial for demand planning.

One important limitation of the Hybrid Weighted Averaging method, however, is that it becomes less suitable when the point forecast deviates significantly from the central tendency of the probabilistic forecast. In such cases, the Hybrid Bias Adjustment method, designed to handle larger deviations, may be preferable. However, the bias adjustment method produced higher errors overall. In practice, this method can apply significant adjustments to the probabilistic forecast; therefore, obtaining expert opinion on its estimates would be beneficial for evaluating its performance more effectively.

The performance evaluation of both point and probabilistic forecasts across methods showed consistent results. The MASE and CRPS analyses reveal that top ML methods—RF, LGBM, XGB, and ML combined—consistently outperform time series methods in both point and probabilistic forecasting, with the RF method ranking highest on both metrics among ML methods. This suggests that ML methods generalize well across diverse time series patterns (smooth, erratic, lumpy, intermittent) within the FPSC context, effectively handling the underlying complexity of the data. Existing literature supports these findings, indicating that ML methods are better equipped to handle underlying uncertainties compared to time series methods [@makridakis2022]. Moreover, the consistent performance of ML methods underscores their robustness in capturing data dynamics over time. However, the MLR method did not perform as well as other ML methods. This discrepancy may stem from the linearity assumption inherent in MLR, whereas real-world FPSC data likely exhibit more complex, non-linear patterns, which MLR struggles to capture effectively.

Despite these results, time series methods should not be entirely discounted. For example, the SBA method, while outperformed by ML methods, surpassed many other time series approaches in terms of MASE, suggesting that it may be more suitable for site-level contraceptive demand data, which often exhibit low or zero demand. @syntetos2009 also highlight the suitability of the SBA method for such scenarios, though its limitation lies in its inability to provide forecast distributions [@hyndman2021forecasting]. Additionally, it is notable that when BSTS methods were provided with time series based predictors and categorical and date features as regressors, they performed significantly better than when demographic predictors were used. A potential reason for this could be the annual granularity of demographic predictors, whereas this study focuses on monthly data.

Interestingly, foundational methods did not outperform top ML-based methods. When trained as univariate methods in a zero-shot setting, they performed similarly to time series methods, offering no clear advantage. Although foundational methods are typically trained on large time series datasets from various domains [@garza; @rasul; @ansari], the time series data observed in the FPSC context pose additional challenges such as noise, inaccuracy, and incompleteness [@bearak2020]. This highlights the need for pretraining these methods on time series data from the humanitarian sector, which shares similar data challenges. @carriero found that foundational methods perform better with stationary time series, and they emphasize the importance of incorporating external factors such as expert knowledge. Our study corroborates this by showing that the incorporation of external regressors significantly improved the forecasting performance of the TimeGPT method.

Furthermore, the current methods applied to contraceptive demand planning demonstrate that both the moving average and demographic methods underperform, with the demographic method being the worst. One possible reason for this is that family planning indicators are often based on assumptions [@akhlaghi2013], and these indicators are calculated at the national or global level [@new2017], making them less reflective of local patterns. Additionally, the demographic method provides estimates of total need rather than consumption, which can lead to discrepancies between estimates and actual consumption [@akhlaghi2013]. Additionally, our analysis of forecast performance across multiple time horizons revealed that method performance remained stable over time. Notably, the USAID competition submissions were not able to outperform the top five methods in our study.

Finally, we assessed the trade-off between computational efficiency and forecast accuracy. While RF achieved the high accuracy, it also demanded greater computational resources. The Hybrid Weighted Averaging, LGBM, and XGB methods offered a balanced solution, delivering high accuracy with moderate computational demands. time series, Bayesian, and foundational methods were computationally efficient but less accurate. TimeGPT with external regressors, though not the most accurate, achieved a balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it suitable for resource-constrained contexts where moderate accuracy is acceptable.

In practice, healthcare sites generate forecasts monthly, and thus, moderately efficient methods like LGBM are often a suitable choice. LGBM’s track record in forecasting competitions like M5 [@makridakis2022], as well as its strong performance in this study, further support its practical applicability. Accordingly, our proposed hybrid combination approach could be employed to combine judgment forecasts with probabilistic forecasts generated using LGBM.

## Managerial implications

Demand forecasting for contraceptives in developing countries is a critical managerial task, given the volatile and unpredictable nature of demand. However, many field-level staff still rely on basic methods like moving averages or demographic projections, which often fall short in addressing these complexities. Our research underscores the need to transition to advanced probabilistic forecasting approaches that provide a range of potential outcomes rather than a single-point estimate. This shift can enable field-level staff to better anticipate demand variability and uncertainty. For example, by using prediction intervals, field-level staff can align their decisions with specific priorities, such as minimizing stockouts by adopting more effective ordering strategies during periods of high variability.

Additionally, our findings highlight the importance of integrating domain expertise with ML forecasts to address the limitations of purely data-driven approaches. The variability in ML performance, particularly in capturing extreme demand patterns, points to the value of a hybrid approach. By allowing expert judgement to refine ML outputs, this method improves transparency and ensures alignment with the specific goals of FPSC. Field-level staff can therefore benefit from actionable insights while avoiding the "black box" nature of many advanced forecasting methods.

To further aid field-level staff, we developed a practical guideline (see @tbl-guide in **Appendix 2**) that compares various forecasting methods tested in our study. This resource builds on prior frameworks, such as the *Contraceptive Forecasting Handbook* by @familyplanninglogisticsmanagement2000, but goes further by incorporating advanced techniques like Bayesian modeling and hybrid methods tailored for uncertain demand environments. This guideline serves as a roadmap for field-level staff to select the most suitable method for their operational context, improving decision-making quality and efficiency.

Lastly, one of the broader implications of our study is its potential for replication in other sectors. The adaptability of our proposed method means that it can be applied to other humanitarian or public health contexts that deal with volatile demand patterns, such as food aid distribution or medical supply chains. The ability to generalize this approach across various sectors ensures that field-level staff in different industries can also benefit from improved forecasting practices, thereby increasing the overall reliability and resilience of their supply chains.

## Limitations and future directions

While our study provides valuable insights into contraceptive demand forecasting using a variety of methods, certain limitations need to be acknowledged. First, although we compared the point and probabilistic forecast performance across different methods ranging from statistical, Bayesian, ML, to foundational, we did not conduct a detailed diagnostic analysis of how each method behaves in the presence of volatile time series, such as those typical of contraceptive demand. Volatile time series can exhibit erratic patterns, discontinuations, and unexpected spikes, complicating the forecasting process.

There are two main challenges in addressing this issue. First, methods trained in a global setting (where one method handles all series) allow for easier diagnostics. However, methods trained in a local setting (where one method is fitted per time series) make diagnostic processes significantly more complicated due to the large number of methods involved. Second, there is no standard diagnostic framework that applies across different model families, making it difficult to compare models with varied structures. Future research should explore the development of a standardized diagnostic framework for diverse forecasting models, particularly in the context of contraceptive demand, as such a framework could improve our understanding of how models behave under real-world complexities.

Another limitation is that our linear equal-weighted forecasts did not perform as well as expected. This may be due to the assumption that all forecasts were well-calibrated, and thus their combination would be too. However, the combined forecasts may have been miscalibrated, resulting in lower performance. This issue applies to our proposed methods as well. While some research on forecast calibration exists, such as the work by @ranjan, further investigation is needed to improve post-calibration processes in our hybrid methods and linear pooling approaches. Improving calibration could enhance both accuracy and reliability in demand forecasting.

On the other hand, FPSC is often subject to uncertainties arising from complex demand patterns, variable lead times, and dependence on donor support [@mukasa2017]. For instance, demographic factors like the age structure of a region can influence contraceptive demand. @haakenstad2022 highlighted that young women (ages 15-25) tend to prefer short-term contraceptive methods, while older, married women are more likely to use long-term methods. However, even these behaviors are heavily influenced by social and cultural beliefs [@sedgh2016]. In some regions, such as India, long-term contraceptive methods are popular among younger women [@hellwig2022]. Given such complexities, incorporating expert knowledge during the method-building process as predictive factors could help address these issues. Identifying and defining such influencing factors and incorporating them into forecasting methods remains an important research area for future exploration.

Another key issue in the FPSC is the presence of censored demand due to stockouts, under-reporting, or discontinuations. In our methoding process, we did not account for these scenarios. Future research should explore how to develop forecasting methods that can handle stockout data, mitigate its impact on decision-making. Moreover, addressing the challenges of cold starts (multiple origin points) and cold ends (discontinuations) in time series forecasting is crucial, as these are prevalent in FPSC and should be considered in future methods.

Additionally, we did not consider product switching or substitution in response to availability or accessibility issues. Unlike other supply chains, contraceptive product substitution is challenging because each product has unique attributes, such as effectiveness and coverage period. Moreover, women's preferences are influenced by health concerns—many women are reluctant to switch products they have used long-term due to perceived health risks [@sedgh2014]. Younger women, for instance, may avoid long-term contraceptives, fearing they could affect future fertility [@hellwig2022]. Investigating how to incorporate product-switching behaviors into the forecasting process is an important area for future research.

Finally, forecast distributions are just one aspect of logistics management in contraceptive demand forecasting. Decision-makers need to understand how to use forecast data for FPSC operations like inventory optimization, distribution, and procurement. As @raftery2016 suggests, forecasts may only need to provide prediction intervals or quantiles in some cases to inform decisions. Whether this approach applies to FPSC remains an open question. Future research should explore how to effectively communicate probabilistic forecasts and integrate them with inventory management, assessing the practical benefits for FPSC decision-making and improving planning and strategy formulation.
