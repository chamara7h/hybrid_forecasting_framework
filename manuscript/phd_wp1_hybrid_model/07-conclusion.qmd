# Conclusion {#sec-conclusion}

Effective forecasting and planning within the FPSC are essential to ensure that contraceptives are consistently and readily available to those who need them [@mukasa2017]. Accurate and reliable demand forecasting is therefore critical within the FPSC, as it supports informed decision-making to ensure access to safe and effective contraceptives. This, in turn, empowers individuals and communities to make informed reproductive health choices and helps reduce the unmet need for contraceptives [@ahmed2019].

Our study points out the need to improve contraceptive demand forecasting by combining probabilistic forecasting methods with expert knowledge, especially within the FPSC. Current forecasting methods often use simple methods, like moving averages or basic demographic approaches, which don't fully capture the complexities of contraceptive demand. These patterns are influenced by various factors, including stockouts, product switching, and socio-demographic variables. While system-generated forecasts are good at showing past trends, literature shows that expert input is vital for refining forecasts in real-world situations with incomplete data and changing demand [@fildes2007]. Therefore, we propose a new framework that enhances contraceptive demand forecasting by merging probabilistic methods with expert insights. This combined approach offers a promising solution for dealing with the uncertainties and complexities of contraceptive demand in developing countries.

Our proposed hybrid method, which combines point forecasts with probabilistic distributions, offers a promising way to improve forecasts by incorporating expert knowledge. The hybrid weighted averaging method strikes a good balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it effective for adjusting probabilistic forecasts where the algorithm has already accounted for most uncertainties. Although the hybrid bias adjustment method showed higher error rates, it allows for important adjustments to probabilistic forecasts using point forecasts, especially in situations with stockouts and incomplete data, offering greater flexibility to integrate expert judgment.

Furthermore, we review various forecasting methods, including time series, Bayesian, foundational time series, and machine learning methods, along with our new hybrid methods. We provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, their computational efficiency, and their most appropriate use cases. This makes our study a useful guide for forecasting contraceptive demand.

In summary, our study addresses a key gap in probabilistic forecasting for contraceptive demand and presents a combined approach that blends algorithmic and human expertise. The findings from this study improve forecasting methods within the FPSC and offer practical recommendations for better contraceptive forecasting in developing countries.
