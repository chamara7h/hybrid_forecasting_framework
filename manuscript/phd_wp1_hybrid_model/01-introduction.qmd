# Introduction {#sec-intro}

A fundamental aspect of ensuring reliable access to contraceptive products lies in accurate demand forecasting, as demand forecasting forms the foundation of efficient and reliable procurement, sourcing, storage, allocation, and distribution processes for contraceptive products [@altay2022]. However, the task of producing accurate and reliable demand forecasts for contraceptives in developing countries presents numerous challenges [@de-arteaga2018]. These challenges include the unavailability of comprehensive data [@lacroix2023], poor data quality [@deboeck2023], and the necessity to forecast across multiple geographical and product hierarchies [@sedgh2016].

Despite the complexity inherent in demand forecasting, many forecasts in practice are often generated using simple methods such as the moving average of historical consumption data or demographic forecasting techniques [@familyplanninglogisticsmanagement2000]. However, these methods rarely consider the complexities introduced by users switching from one contraceptive method to another, driven by factors such as the introduction of new products, health concerns, or issues with accessibility and availability [@akhlaghi2013]. This inadequacy contributes to inefficiencies in the family planning supply chain (FPSC) affecting the availability of contraceptive products [@mukasa2017].

Evidence from the PMA2020 survey[^01-introduction-1] further underscores this issue, revealing that many health sites and contraceptive outlets in developing countries often face stockouts of contraceptive methods [@ahmed2019]. Such stockouts limit access to contraceptive products for users when needed, either by restricting the availability of preferred methods or by turning away users due to product unavailability [@new2017]. Consequently, these challenges contribute to an increase in unmet demand[^01-introduction-2] for contraceptive products [@Baker2022].

[^01-introduction-2]: unmet demand is defined as the percentage of women of reproductive age who currently have a need for family planning but are either not using any contraceptive methods or whose partners are not using them [@haakenstad2022].

The unmet demand for contraceptives is a significant concern, as it leads to an estimated 121 million unintended pregnancies each year, roughly 331,000 per day [@UnitedNations2021]. This situation incurs substantial costs, both for women and children and for society at large [@sedgh2016]. Over 60% of unintended pregnancies end in abortion, whether safe or unsafe, legal or illegal, posing significant risks to women's lives [@bearak2020]. Unfortunately, over 45% of these abortions are unsafe and result in maternal deaths [@say2014]. This situation is particularly worse in developing countries, where approximately 7 million women are hospitalized each year due to unsafe abortions [@singh2016]. Moreover, this also creates a public health crisis, costing an estimated 2.8 billion USD per year for abortion and post-abortion care in low- and middle-income countries [@sully2020]. Recognizing its importance, this issue has been prioritized as essential for achieving the 2023 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Despite efforts by governments, foundations, and donors to increase the uptake of contraceptive products through policy and program interventions [@mukasa2017], developing countries continue to experience high unmet demand, particularly due to persistent stockouts at local health sites and contraceptive outlets [@sedgh2014]. A key reason for this ongoing issue is that these efforts and assessments are largely focused on the national or global level, which can mask the ground reality due to local disparities [@new2017].

Recognizing the need for an improved forecasting process at the local health site level, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched the *"Intelligent Forecasting Challenge: Model Future Contraceptive Use"* [@USAID2020]. This competition aimed to source new solutions, test novel ideas, and scale effective approaches for contraceptive demand forecasting using not only time series methods but also data driven methods like machine learning (ML). However, the competition missed a critical element of the contraceptive demand forecasting process: quantifying and communicating the uncertainty, as it focused exclusively on point forecasts. On the other hand, the FPSC in developing countries is often associated with numerous uncertainties, including complex patterns of demand, variable lead times, and dependence on donor support [@mircetic2022]. These factors further exacerbate demand uncertainty, necessitating the use of probabilistic estimations to quantify the uncertainty of future demand.

Discussions with USAID officials highlighted that decision-makers are particularly interested in the upper bounds of prediction intervals, as they are keen to mitigate the risk of stockouts, a critical issue in contraceptive supply chains. As @lacroix2023 have noted, despite the acknowledged need for probabilistic approaches, point predictions remain the default due to the lack of standardized methodologies for incorporating uncertainty into contraceptive demand forecasts. Probabilistic estimations, by quantifying the uncertainty inherent in these predictions, thus represent a valuable tool for managing stock levels and reducing the risk of supply shortages.

To our knowledge, no previous work has focused on probabilistic forecasting in contraceptive demand estimation within the FPSC at the local healthcare site level. Thus, this paper first addresses this gap by investigating a probabilistic forecasting approach for estimating demand for contraceptive products using data from January 2016 to December 2019, extracted from the Logistics Management Information System (LMIS) of Cote d'Ivoire. This is the same dataset that was used in the competition. Moreover, since the publication of the *Contraceptive Forecasting Handbook*, which focuses on simple forecasting methods (see @familyplanninglogisticsmanagement2000 for more information), there has been no literature evaluating the applicability and usability of different forecasting methods in contraceptive demand forecasting. Therefore, in this study, we employ a range of forecasting methods, including time series, Bayesian, ML and foundational time series methods[^02], to produce point forecasts along with probabilistic forecasts for all products across all healthcare sites.

Additionally, demand planners widely apply judgmental adjustments to incorporate external factors based on their expertise in the FPSC setting [@altay2022]. Our discussions with USAID professionals revealed similar insights; they explained that site-level demand planners often adjust system-generated forecasts or use judgmental forecasts to eliminate data inaccuracies. These inaccuracies may arise because the data used to prepare these forecasts may not reflect true demand due to stockouts or incomplete data collection, or because planners have additional information, such as product discontinuation [@deboeck2023]. Hence, the human factor is valuable in this forecasting setup [@lacroix2023].

Given that system-generated forecasts and human forecasts offer distinct benefits, it is vital to design a hybrid intelligence system that combines them. In this context, where site-level demand planners produce point forecasts, we are particularly interested in how to combine point forecasts with probabilistic forecasts to produce combined probabilistic forecasts. However, the literature often treats point forecast combination methods and probabilistic forecast combination methods separately [@wang2023]. To address this gap, we propose a Constrained Quantile Regression Averaging (CQRA) method[^03] to combine point forecasts made by experts with probabilistic forecasts generated by a system-based forecasting method. We compare the forecast performance using the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE), a scale-independent metric that provides robustness and stability for point forecasts, and Continuous Ranked Probability Scores (CRPS), a widely used metric in probabilistic forecasting that assesses the sharpness and calibration of the forecast distribution for probabilistic forecasts in a cross-validation setup. Finally, we compare our method results against the submissions from the competition.

These models require no or minimal tuning and can handle complex temporal patterns efficiently.

[^03]: CQRA: A statistical method that combines multiple quantile regression models while enforcing constraints to ensure coherence and interpretability of predictions. It enhances robustness by optimizing weights assigned to different models under quantile-specific constraints, improving accuracy in heterogeneous data settings.

Thus, our contributions are as follows:

1.  We produce point forecasts along with forecast distributions for contraceptive products at the healthcare site level, quantifying uncertainties in future contraceptive demand.

2.  We develop a novel method to combine point forecasts with probabilistic forecasts, allowing human experts to incorporate their expertise into the forecast and thereby providing a hybrid intelligence system.

3.  We provide a detailed comparison of the performance of time series, Bayesian, ML and foundational time series methods, and our proposed hybrid method. Additionally, we provide a comparison of the computational requirements for each method, offering a holistic view of the differences between these forecasting methods.

4.  We have made the code and data for our proposed method, along with all other methods used in this study, publicly accessible to ensure the reproducibility. Furthermore, our study adheres to the replication principle [@boylan2015], allowing for the method's generalization across various sectors with similar data patterns.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of the literature and discusses its limitations to position our work. In Section 3, we discuss the data and the experimental setup. Section 4 presents the results of our analysis. In Section 5, we summarize our findings, discuss the limitations, and present ideas for future research directions.
